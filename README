smlr is a simple URL shortener for the web.

Not too sure on setup instructions just yet. It should be fairly straightforward though.

 * Download
 * Setup database
 * Change settings.py database credentials
 * Change settings.py SECRET_KEY, templates, static etc. settings
 * Run `python manage.py syncdb'
 * Run `python manager.py runserver'
